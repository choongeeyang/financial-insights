## What is FinSight API?

FinSight API bridges the gap between raw financial disclosures and actionable developer tooling. It ingests quarterly and annual reports from Malaysian Blue-Chip companies, extracts structured financial tables, and surfaces the data through a developer API, interactive dashboard, and AI-powered analysis layer.
