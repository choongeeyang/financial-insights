## Branching Strategy

```
main          ← production-ready, protected
develop       ← integration branch
feature/*     ← new features (branch from develop)
fix/*         ← bug fixes
docs/*        ← documentation-only changes
```

---

## Development Workflow

1. Create a branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the code style guidelines below.

3. Write or update tests.

4. Open a pull request against `develop` with a clear description.
